# SPI_Device_Driver_For_CortexM_Microcontroller
In this project I have tried to make SPI driver as generic as possible for development board having Cortex-M processor,
I have coded it for STM32F446re microcontroller board but, can be configure for various other Cortex-M microcontroller boards by making few changes depending on board hardware connection. 

Also, the main function (Application) is for your reference on how you can use the function, to setup the SPI configuration by including the Driver header file as static library in your code.
